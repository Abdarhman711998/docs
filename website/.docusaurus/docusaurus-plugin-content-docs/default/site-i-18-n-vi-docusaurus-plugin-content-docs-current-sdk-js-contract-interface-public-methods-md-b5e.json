  "description": "Methods can be called externally by using the view({}) or call({}) decorators within the contract class which will expose the method in the compiled WASM bytecode to be called by any other NEAR Account. Whenever a method is declared in your contract class without these decorators and is called by another NEAR Account, a MethodNotFound error will be thrown.",
