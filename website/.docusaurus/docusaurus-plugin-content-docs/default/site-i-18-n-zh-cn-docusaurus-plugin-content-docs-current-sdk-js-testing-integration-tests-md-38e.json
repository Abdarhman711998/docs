  "description": "NEAR Simulator was meant to be an in-place replacement of a blockchain environment for the purpose of testing NEAR contracts. However, simulating NEAR ledger turned out to be a much more complex endeavor than was anticipated. Eventually, the idea of workspaces was born - a library for automating workflows and writing tests for NEAR smart contracts using a real NEAR network (localnet, testnet or mainnet). Thus, NEAR Simulator is being deprecated in favor of workspaces-rs, the Rust edition of workspaces. As the two libraries have two vastly different APIs this guide was created to ease the migration process for developers.",
