  "description": "NEAR is asynchronous by design. While it opens a wide range of possibilities for smart contracts implementations, it may also add to confusion among beginners and newcomers from other blockchain platforms. Transactions in NEAR may contain actions that do asynchronous work, in such cases keep in mind the possible outcomes of success or failure of the transaction. For example, if a transaction contains a cross-contract call, it may be marked as successful, but the other contract execution might fail. This article covers possible scenarios for this.",
