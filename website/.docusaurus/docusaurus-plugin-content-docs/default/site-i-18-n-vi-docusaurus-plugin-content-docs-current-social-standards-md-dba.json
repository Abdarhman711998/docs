  "description": "The data in SocialDB is organized as a simple JSON tree. The only enforced rule is that the keys in the root are the account IDs that store the data. This is done on purpose, so the SocialDB contract is not enforcing any structure or a schema. Otherwise, the contract has to be modified for every schema change. The control of the contract schemas can lead to the centralization and restrictions. Instead, Near Social Standards live outside the SocialDB contract.",
