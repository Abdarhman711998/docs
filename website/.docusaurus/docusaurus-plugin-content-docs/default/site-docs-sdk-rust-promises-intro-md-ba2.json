  "description": "Transactions can be sent asynchronously from a contract through a Promise. Like Promises in many programming languages, these will cause code to be executed in the future. In the case of NEAR, this \"in the future\" means a transaction to be executed in the next block_ (or thereabouts), rather than in the same block as the original function call.",
