### Receiving Fungible Tokens

NEAR has deployed a new Fungible Token contract to the account `ft.predeployed.examples.testnet` which allows users to freely receive some `gtNEAR` - a new fungible token aimed to promote the power of teamwork! Each `gtNEAR` is equal to `1e24 yocto-gtNEAR` similar to how 1 $NEAR is equal to 1e24 yoctoNEAR.

Using this pre-deployed contract, let's get some gtNEAR!

Start by calling the method `ft_mint` which is a custom function implemented on this contract in order to send your account some `gtNEAR`! The following command will send `0.01 gtNEAR` to your account.

```bash
near call ft.predeployed.examples.testnet ft_mint '{"account_id": "'$NEARID'", "amount": "10000000000000000000000"}' --accountId $NEARID
```

- To view tokens owned by an account you can call the FT contract with the following `near-cli` command:

```bash
near view ft.predeployed.examples.testnet ft_balance_of '{"account_id": "'$NEARID'"}'
```

***Ch√∫c m·ª´ng! You just received your first Team Tokens on the NEAR blockchain!*** üéâ

üëâ Now try going to your [NEAR Wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com) and view your FTs in the "Balances" tab. üëà

:::note Pre-deployed Contract
The contract used in this section has been modified such that you can infinitely get `gtNEAR` by calling `ft_mint`. This function is not part of the FT [standards](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleToken/Core) and has been implemented for the purpose of this tutorial.

## C√°c ch√∫ th√≠ch cu·ªëi c√πng

This basic example illustrates all the required steps to call an FT smart contract on NEAR and receive your own fungible tokens.

Now that you're familiar with the process, you can jump to [Contract Architecture](/tutorials/fts/skeleton) and learn more about the smart contract structure and how you can build your own FT contract from the ground up.
