  "description": "We can allow methods to accept a NEAR token transfer together with the function call. This is done so that contracts can define a fee in tokens that needs to be paid when they are used. By default the methods are not payable and they will throw an error if someone will attempt to attach tokens to them during the invocation. This is done for safety reasons, in case someone accidentally transfers tokens during the function call.
